## Migration Guides

### From Other Resume Parsers

If you're migrating from other resume parsing solutions:

#### From Lever API
```python
# Old Lever API approach
# response = requests.post('https://jobs.lever.co/parseResume', files={'resume': file})

# New PyResume approach
from pyresume import ResumeParser
parser = ResumeParser()
resume = parser.parse('resume.pdf')
```

#### From Custom Solutions
```python
# Replace custom parsing logic
# old_data = custom_resume_parser(file_path)

# With PyResume
from pyresume import ResumeParser
parser = ResumeParser()
resume = parser.parse(file_path)

# Convert to your format
data = {
    'name': resume.contact_info.name,
    'email': resume.contact_info.email,
    'experience': [
        {
            'title': exp.title,
            'company': exp.company,
            'start_date': exp.start_date,
            'end_date': exp.end_date
        }
        for exp in resume.experience
    ]
}
```
