# Contributing to PyResume

We love your input! We want to make contributing to PyResume as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyresume.git
   cd pyresume
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

4. **Run tests to verify setup**:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** with the following guidelines:
   - Write clear, documented code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Follow our coding standards

3. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest
   
   # Run with coverage
   pytest --cov=pyresume --cov-report=html
   
   # Run specific test file
   pytest tests/test_parser.py -v
   ```

4. **Check code quality**:
   ```bash
   # Format code
   black pyresume/
   
   # Check style
   flake8 pyresume/
   
   # Type checking
   mypy pyresume/
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork and submit a pull request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Flake8** for style checking
- **MyPy** for type checking
- **pytest** for testing

#### Code Formatting
```bash
# Format all Python files
black pyresume/ tests/ examples/

# Check formatting without making changes
black --check pyresume/
```

#### Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep line length under 88 characters (Black default)

#### Example Code Style
```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Experience:
    """Represents a work experience entry from a resume.
    
    Args:
        title: Job title or position name
        company: Company or organization name
        start_date: Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
        end_date: End date in YYYY-MM-DD format, None if current
        description: Job description or responsibilities
        location: Work location (city, state/country)
    """
    title: Optional[str] = None
    company: Optional[str] = None
    start_date: Optional[str] = None
    end_date: Optional[str] = None
    description: Optional[str] = None
    location: Optional[str] = None


def parse_experience_section(text: str) -> List[Experience]:
    """Parse the experience section of a resume.
    
    Args:
        text: Raw text from the experience section
        
    Returns:
        List of Experience objects extracted from the text
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the text cannot be parsed
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Test Structure
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Mirror the source code structure in test files
- Use descriptive test function names

#### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete parsing workflows
3. **Fixture Tests**: Test with real resume examples

#### Writing Tests
```python
import pytest
from pyresume import ResumeParser
from pyresume.models.resume import Resume


class TestResumeParser:
    """Test cases for the ResumeParser class."""
    
    def test_parse_contact_info_with_email(self):
        """Test parsing contact information containing email."""
        parser = ResumeParser()
        text = "John Doe\\njohn.doe@email.com\\n(555) 123-4567"
        
        resume = parser.parse_text(text)
        
        assert resume.contact_info.name == "John Doe"
        assert resume.contact_info.email == "john.doe@email.com"
        assert resume.contact_info.phone == "(555) 123-4567"
    
    def test_parse_invalid_file_raises_error(self):
        """Test that parsing non-existent file raises appropriate error."""
        parser = ResumeParser()
        
        with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
            parser.parse("non_existent_file.pdf")
    
    @pytest.mark.integration
    def test_parse_complete_resume_fixture(self):
        """Integration test using complete resume fixture."""
        parser = ResumeParser()
        resume = parser.parse("tests/fixtures/resume_standard.txt")
        
        # Verify all major sections were parsed
        assert resume.contact_info.name is not None
        assert resume.contact_info.email is not None
        assert len(resume.experience) > 0
        assert len(resume.education) > 0
        assert len(resume.skills) > 0
```

#### Test Fixtures
We provide several test fixtures for development:

- `resume_standard.txt`: Well-formatted professional resume
- `resume_minimal.txt`: Basic resume with minimal information
- `resume_complex.txt`: Complex formatting and multiple sections
- `resume_edge_cases.txt`: Special characters and edge cases
- `resume_international.txt`: Non-English resume example
- `resume_malformed.txt`: Poorly structured resume

### Documentation

#### Docstring Style
Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def extract_skills(text: str, categories: Dict[str, List[str]]) -> List[Skill]:
    """Extract skills from resume text using predefined categories.
    
    This function searches for skills mentioned in the resume text and
    categorizes them based on the provided skill categories dictionary.
    
    Args:
        text: Resume text to search for skills
        categories: Dictionary mapping category names to lists of skills
        
    Returns:
        List of Skill objects found in the text, with categories assigned
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If categories dictionary is empty or malformed
        
    Example:
        >>> categories = {"programming": ["Python", "Java"]}
        >>> skills = extract_skills("I know Python and Java", categories)
        >>> len(skills)
        2
    """
```

#### README Updates
When adding new features, update the README.md with:
- New API examples
- Updated feature lists
- Performance impact (if significant)
